# Creating a grid of game

Repository presents code for a create the grid of game. At the moment developed the creation of one type of a hexagonal grid (more information about the hexagonal grids https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/). 
I'm going to provided a user a choice betwen any type of the hexagonal grids or a square grid. Also I'm going to develop a mathamatical functional which needed for this type taskes.

This is project didn't finish and it develop now because of this you can see some bit bad code and some irrelevant comments. Please, not will be angry to me. I hope correct this as soon as possible but the process can be delayed because of fact which this project doesn't main and I develop one in out of duty.
